The main prerequisites to run the source code are:  
● Node.js  
● Node Package Manager (npm)  
● MongoDB  

If all three of these are satisfied, the code can be run by:  
● Opening the terminal at the source code folder.  
● Launching the mongo shell by using the command ‘mongo’.  
● Issuing the command ‘use testDB’ in the mongo shell.  
● Issuing the command ‘use session’ in the mongo shell.  
● Now that the database has been created and selected, the mongo shell can be exited.  
● To install the dependencies we have used in the project, the command ‘n​ pm install​’ can be run.  
● Finally, to start the server, ‘n​ pm start’​ can be run.  
● With the server running, the website will be accessible on
https://localhost:5000
